# CMOEBO-D 
The name of the algorithm is "A Novel Constrained Multiobjective Evolutionary Bayesian Optimization Algorithm based on Decomposition". The algorithm is designed to solve expensive constrained multiobjective optimization problems, and is implemented in Matlab based on PlatEMO 3.5 (https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO).

"Automotive_Rear_Safety_System.Zip" denotes the crashworthiness design of automotive rear safety system. "DP800_Steel.Zip" denotes the parameter calibration of DP800 steel. These two real-world applications are implemented based on the LSDYNA finite element solver (revision R11.0.0). In the Zip files, "ProblemSet.m" excutes the parameter settings, and "Fitness.m" calculates the objectives and constraints of solutions.
